# Battle of the Ricks

**Battle of the Ricks** is a Rick and Morty-inspired multiverse card duel game where players use characters, gadgets, and locations from the Rick and Morty universe to battle it out! The goal is to reduce your opponent's health to zero or outsmart them by achieving special win conditions. This game is built with React to help you dive into chaotic, turn-based action!

## Game Concept

Players battle using decks that feature:

- **Characters**: Rick, Morty, Summer, etc.
- **Gadgets**: Portal Gun, Meeseeks Box, etc.
- **Locations**: Citadel of Ricks, Bird Person's home.

Each card has unique abilities and stats like Attack, Defense, Speed, and Intelligence. Players take turns attacking, defending, or performing special moves using these cards.

### Goal:
The first player to reduce the opponentâ€™s health points to zero or achieve a special win condition wins!

## Features

### Cards:
- **Rick Sanchez**: High intelligence, low defense.
- **Mr. Meeseeks**: Can instantly attack but disappears afterward.
- **Portal Gun**: Swap cards between decks or bring a card back from the discard pile.

### React Components:
- **Card**: Displays individual cards with character stats and abilities.
- **Board**: Shows cards in play (for both player and opponent).
- **Scoreboard**: Tracks health points and score.
- **Deck/Hand Management**: Players draw cards from their deck and manage their hands.
- **Turn-based System**: Players alternate turns to play cards, attack, and perform actions.

### Special Game Mechanics:
- **Multiverse Random Events**: After several rounds, multiverse events occur that alter the game rules, like an interdimensional rift that swaps cards or changes player stats for a round.

## How to Play:
1. Build your deck from characters, gadgets, and locations.
2. Draw cards and manage your hand.
3. Take turns attacking, defending, or performing special abilities.
4. Keep an eye out for multiverse events that change the game dynamics!
